## Counter-Strike Global Offensive Position Analyzer

This application provides a data-driven, strategic view of player and grenade positions in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. The inspiration for development comes from chess book openings and position analyzers. In its infancy, the tool finds rounds that have setups similar to the proposed position and returns win percentages with links to HLTV recordings of rounds that showed those positions. Eventually, I would like to use these data to use a nueral network to rank player and grenade setups and to have the tool automatically identify the best attacks for certain defenses and the best defenses for certain offenses. Currently, CSGO strategies are built on intuition - I hope this tool can help bring data-driven analysis into the game!
